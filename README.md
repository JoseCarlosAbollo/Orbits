This code draws a grid with some uniform circular motions (UCMs) in its first row (increasing angular speed to the right) and its first column (increasing angular speed to the bottom).
The grid then is filled with patterns originated from taking the same x axis for each cell in a column and the same y axis for each cell in a row.
